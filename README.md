# TASK DESCRIPTION

This project presents a basic yet functional security system prototype utilizing an Arduino Nano, a sonar sensor (HC-SR04), and a servo motor. The sonar sensor continuously monitors the distance in its field of view. Upon detecting a significant decrease in distance, indicating potential motion . Additionally, the servo motor rotates to physically indicate the direction where the motion was detected, providing a rudimentary spatial awareness of the event. This prototype demonstrates the fundamental principles of motion detection and simple actuation for security applications.

**COMPONENTS**

- Arduino Nano: A small, powerful microcontroller that will be the brain of your system. It will read data from the sonar sensor, control the servo motor, and potentially trigger an alert.

- Sonar Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04): This sensor emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time it takes for the echo to return, allowing you to calculate the distance to an object. It's excellent for detecting movement within a certain range.

- Servo Motor: A motor that can rotate to a specific angle. You can use it to pan the sonar sensor for a wider field of view or to act as a physical indicator (e.g., pointing towards the detected motion).
