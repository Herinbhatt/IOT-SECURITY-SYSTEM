# TASK DESCRIPTION

This project presents a basic yet functional security system prototype utilizing an Arduino Nano, a sonar sensor (HC-SR04), and a servo motor. The sonar sensor continuously monitors the distance in its field of view. Upon detecting a significant decrease in distance, indicating potential motion . Additionally, the servo motor rotates to physically indicate the direction where the motion was detected, providing a rudimentary spatial awareness of the event. This prototype demonstrates the fundamental principles of motion detection and simple actuation for security applications.
